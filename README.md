# Hackathon Ideas
Below is a list of ideas of small projects that I would like to take on. Each minimum-viable-product could be easily done with a small group in a weekend or a hackathon.

### Dev Tools
* [OneConfig](http://schrismart.in/hackathon-ideas/OneConfig.html) – A cloud based solution for storing config variables for apps.

### Web Projects
* Bathroom Wall – A chrome extension providing a short message board for any website.
* [Don't Shoot The Messenger](https://github.com/schrismartin/dont-shoot-the-messenger) – A text-based adventure game built for the Facebook Messenger platform
* Emojify – Website that takes an image and replaces a face with its representative emoji

### iOS Projects
* Grade – An app that keeps track of assignments and their individual impacts on your grade in a course.
